6. Article 1 of Decree-law No 380/93 of 15 November 1993 provides:

1. The acquisition inter vivos, with or without consideration, by a single natural or legal person, of shares representing more than 10% of the voting capital, and the acquisition of shares which, when added to those already owned, exceeds that limit, in companies which are to be privatised, will require the prior authorisation of the Minister for Financial Affairs.

2. Subject to the conditions laid down for each privatisation procedure, the provisions of the previous paragraph will apply only to acquisitions made following privatisation.

Case C-483/99, Commission v France

7. Article 2 of Decree No 93-1298 of 13 December 1993 creating a special share for the State in Société Nationale Elf-Aquitaine provides that any transaction which causes a natural or legal person, acting alone or with others, to have a direct or indirect holding which exceeds one tenth, one fifth or one third of the company's share capital or its voting rights, must have the prior approval of the Minister for Economic Affairs (Paragraph 1).

8. Furthermore, the Ministers for Economic Affairs and Industry each appoint a non-voting member of the company's board of directors to represent the State (Paragraph 2).

9. In short, the special holding makes it possible to oppose any agreement to sell or charge the company's main assets, in the circumstances laid down in Decree No 93-1296.

10. Decree No 93-1296 of 13 December 1993 concerning, amongst other matters, certain rights linked to special holdings, provides that the decree authorising a person having a special holding to object to operations to sell or charge assets which might adversely affect the national interests must list, in an attached schedule, the assets concerned (Article 1).

11. A statement expressing the intention to sell or charge those assets must be submitted to the Minister for Economic Affairs, together with all the documents necessary for examination of the case. The operation will be deemed to be approved if the Minister does not raise an objection within a period of one month, which may be extended by 15 days, from the date of receipt of the complete file. Before that period elapses, the Minister may waive his right to object (Article 2).

Infringement of these obligations results in automatic annulment of the operations carried out (Paragraph 3).

Case C-503/99, Commission v Belgium

12. A Royal Decree of 10 June 1994 establishes in favour of the State a special holding in Société Nationale de Transport par Canalisations (SNTC), to which are attached certain special powers to be exercised by the Minister for Energy (Article 1).

13. The Minister may object to any transaction relating to the capital of SNTC which might adversely affect national interests in the field of energy (Article 2(1)). Transaction means any operation by which a natural or legal person directly or indirectly acquires 5% or more of the capital or voting rights of SNTC, or increases his holding in the capital or voting rights in such a way as to hold 10% or more (Article 2(2)).

14. The special holding authorises the Minister to object to any sale, charging or change of use of any pipes or conduits owned by SNTC which constitute large infrastructures for the transmission of energy products nationally or which might serve as such. Prior notification of any operation of that nature must be given to the Minister, who has 21 days in which to exercise his right to object (Article 3).

15. Furthermore, the special holding allows the Minister to appoint two Federal Government representatives to SNTC's board of directors, with the right to speak but not to vote. These representatives may appeal to the Minister against resolutions of the board of directors, within four days of their adoption or of the date on which they learn of their adoption, if they consider them to be contrary to Government guidelines on energy policy, including energy supply objectives. Such appeals have suspensory effect and lapse if not upheld within eight days.

16. By virtue of a Royal Decree of 16 June 1994, a similar system applies to the company Distrigaz.

Procedure

17. I do not think the pre-litigation procedure in the three cases displays any points of interest which deserve special attention.

18. The United Kingdom and Spain have intervened, the former in support of France and Belgium and the latter in support of France.

19. At the hearing, I asked the parties appearing to express their views, in particular, on the bearing on the cases of the principle of neutrality in relation to the ownership of companies.
